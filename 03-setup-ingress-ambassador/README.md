# How to Configure Ingress using Ambassador

## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the [Ambassador Edge Stack](https://www.getambassador.io). Then, you're going to discover how to have `SSL` certificates automatically deployed and configured for your hosts, enable `TLS` termination, and `route` traffic to your `backend` applications.

In most of the cases, you will use the `Load Balancer` that is made available by the `Cloud` provider of your choice. In case of `DigitalOcean` when you configure a service as a `Load Balancer`, `DOKS` automatically provisions one in your account. Now, the `service` is exposed to the outside world and can be accessed via the `Load Balancer` endpoint. In a real world scenario, you do not want to use one `Load Balancer` per service, so you need a `proxy` inside the cluster. That is `Ingress`.

When an `Ingress Proxy` is installed, it creates a service and exposes it as a `Load Balancer`. Now, you can have as many services behind the ingress and all accessible through a single endpoint. Ingress operates at the `HTTP` layer.

Let us say you are exposing `REST` or `GRPC` APIs for different tasks (reading account info, writing orders, searching orders, etc.). Depending on the `API`, you will want to be able to route to a specific target. For this to happen, more functionality needs to be built inside the ingress proxy. That is `API Gateway`, and it is capable of doing more things besides routing traffic. For this tutorial, you are going to pick an ingress that can do both `HTTP` routing and `API Gateway`.

As there are many vendors, `Kubernetes API` has an `Ingress` spec. The idea is that developers should be able to use the `Ingress API` and it should work with any vendor. That works well, but has limited capability in the current version. The new version of ingress is called `Gateway API` and is currently in alpha. The idea is the same - users should be able to provide a rich set of ingress configuration using the `Gateway API` syntax. As long as the vendor supports it, users will be able to manage the ingress in a vendor-agnostic way.

Why use the `Ambassador Edge Stack`?

`Ambassador Edge Stack` gives platform engineers a comprehensive, self-service edge stack for managing the boundary between `end-users` and `Kubernetes`. Built on the `Envoy Proxy` and fully `Kubernetes-native`, `Ambassador Edge Stack` is made to support multiple, independent teams that need to rapidly publish, monitor, and update services for end-users. A true edge stack, `Ambassador Edge Stack` can also be used to handle the functions of an `API Gateway`, a `Kubernetes ingress controller` and a `layer 7 load balancer`.

After finishing this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Create and manage `Ambassador Edge Stack` Helm deployments.
- Create and configure the `Ambassador Edge Stack` domain and hosts.
- Automatically configure `SSL` certificates for your `hosts`, and `TLS` termination enabled.
- Create and configure `Ambassador Edge Stack` host mappings.
- Know about `Ambassador Edge Stack` resource usage in your `DOKS` cluster.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you will need:

1. A [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) client, to clone the `Starter Kit` repository.
2. [Helm](https://www.helms.sh), for managing `AES` releases and upgrades.
3. [Doctl](https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl/releases), for `DigitalOcean` API interaction.
4. [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools), for `Kubernetes` interaction.
5. [Curl](https://curl.se/download.html), for testing the examples (backend applications).

Please make sure that `doctl` and `kubectl` context is configured to point to your `Kubernetes` cluster - refer to [Step 2 - Authenticating to DigitalOcean API](../01-setup-DOKS/README.md#step-2---authenticating-to-digitalocean-api) and [Step 3 - Creating the DOKS Cluster](../01-setup-DOKS/README.md#step-3---creating-the-doks-cluster) from the `DOKS` setup tutorial.

## Step 1 - Ambassador Edge Stack Overview

The `Ambassador Edge Stack` or `AES` for short, is a specialized [Control Plane](https://blog.getambassador.io/the-importance-of-control-planes-with-service-meshes-and-front-proxies-665f90c80b3d) for the `Envoy Proxy`. In this architecture, `Ambassador Edge Stack` translates configuration (in the form of `Kubernetes Custom Resources`) to `Envoy` configuration. All the actual traffic is directly handled by the high-performance [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io).

At a very high level, `AES` works as follows:

1. The service owner defines `configuration` via `Kubernetes` manifests.
2. When the manifest is applied to the cluster, the `Kubernetes API` notifies `Ambassador Edge Stack` of the change.
3. `Ambassador Edge Stack` parses the change and transforms the configuration into a semantic intermediate representation. `Envoy` configuration is generated from this `IR`.
4. The new configuration is passed to `Envoy` via the `gRPC-based Aggregated Discovery Service (ADS) API`.
5. Traffic flows through the reconfigured `Envoy`, without dropping any connections.

For more details, please visit: [The Ambassador Edge Stack Architecture](https://www.getambassador.io/docs/edge-stack/2.0/topics/concepts/architecture).

### Starter Kit AES Setup Overview

![Starter Kit AES Setup Overview](assets/images/starter_kit_aes_setup_overview.png)

In the next step, you will learn how to deploy the `Ambassador Edge Stack`, using the `Helm` package manager for `Kubernetes`.

## Step 2 - Installing the Ambassador Edge Stack

In this step, you will deploy the `Ambassador Edge Stack` to your `DOKS` cluster, via `Helm`.

Steps to follow:

1. First, clone the `Starter Kit` repository and change directory to your local copy.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/digitalocean/Kubernetes-Starter-Kit-Developers.git

    cd Kubernetes-Starter-Kit-Developers
    ```

2. Next, add the `Helm` repo, and list the available `charts`:

    ```shell
    helm repo add datawire https://www.getambassador.io

    helm search repo datawire
    ```

    The output looks similar to the following:

    ```text
    NAME                            CHART VERSION   APP VERSION     DESCRIPTION                                       
    datawire/ambassador             6.7.13          1.13.10         A Helm chart for Datawire Ambassador              
    datawire/ambassador-operator    0.3.0           v1.3.0          A Helm chart for Kubernetes                       
    datawire/telepresence           2.4.0           2.4.0           A chart for deploying the server-side component...
    ```

    **Note:**

    The chart of interest is `datawire/ambassador`, which will install `Ambassador Edge Stack` on the cluster. Please visit the [ambassador-chart](https://github.com/datawire/ambassador-chart) page, for more details about this chart.
3. Then, open and inspect the `03-setup-ingress-ambassador/assets/manifests/ambassador-values-v6.7.13.yaml` file provided in the `Starter Kit` repository, using an editor of your choice (preferably with `YAML` lint support). For example, you can use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com):

   ```shell
   code 03-setup-ingress-ambassador/assets/manifests/ambassador-values-v6.7.13.yaml
   ```

   **Note:**

    There are times when you want to re-use the existing `Load Balancer`. This is for preserving your `DNS` settings and other `Load Balancer` configurations. If so, make sure to modify the `ambassador-values-v6.7.13.yaml` file, and add the annotation for your existing `Load Balancer`. Likewise, you can enable `Proxy Protocol` as part of modules section in the `ambassador-values-v6.7.13.yaml` file. Please refer to the `DigitalOcean Kubernetes` guide - [How To Migrate Load Balancers](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/how-to/migrate-load-balancers) for more details.
4. Finally, finish the installation (a dedicated `ambassador` namespace will be created as well):

    ```shell
    HELM_CHART_VERSION="6.7.13"

    helm install ambassador datawire/ambassador --version "$HELM_CHART_VERSION" \
        --namespace ambassador \
        --create-namespace \
        -f "03-setup-ingress-ambassador/assets/manifests/ambassador-values-v${HELM_CHART_VERSION}.yaml"
    ```

    **Note:**

    A `specific` version for the `Helm` chart is used. In this case `6.7.13` was picked, which maps to the `1.13.10` release of `AES` (see the output from `Step 2.`). Itâ€™s good practice in general, to lock on a specific version. This helps to have predictable results, and allows versioning control via `Git`.

## Step 3 - Defining the Domain and Hosts for Ambassador Edge Stack

In a real world scenario each `host` maps to a `service`, so you need a way to tell `AES` about your intentions - meet the [Host](https://www.getambassador.io/docs/edge-stack/1.13/topics/running/host-crd/) CRD.

The custom `Host` resource defines how `Ambassador Edge Stack` will be visible to the outside world. It collects all the following information in a single configuration resource. The most relevant parts are:

- The `hostname` by which `Ambassador Edge Stack` will be reachable
- How `Ambassador Edge Stack` should handle `TLS` certificates
- How `Ambassador Edge Stack` should handle secure and insecure requests

For more details, please visit the [AES Host CRD](https://www.getambassador.io/docs/edge-stack/1.13/topics/running/host-crd/) official documentation.

Notes on `ACME` support:

- If the `Authority` is not supplied, then a `Letâ€™s Encrypt` **production environment** is assumed.
- In general the `registrant email address` is mandatory when using `ACME`, and it should be a valid one in order to receive notifications when the certificates are going to expire.
- `ACME` stores certificates using `Kubernetes Secrets`. The name of the secret can be set using the `tlsSecret` element.

The following example configures the `TLS` enabled `hosts` for this tutorial: [echo_host](assets/manifests/echo_host.yaml) and [quote_host](assets/manifests/quote_host.yaml).

Steps to follow:

1. First, change directory (if not already) where you cloned the `Starter Kit` repository.

   ```shell
    cd Kubernetes-Starter-Kit-Developers
    ```

2. Then, apply the manifests:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f 03-setup-ingress-ambassador/assets/manifests/echo_host.yaml

    kubectl apply -f 03-setup-ingress-ambassador/assets/manifests/quote_host.yaml
    ```

3. Finally, inspect the `AES` hosts:

    ```shell
    kubectl get hosts -n ambassador
    ```

    The output looks similar to the following:

    ```text
    NAME         HOSTNAME                   STATE     PHASE COMPLETED      PHASE PENDING              AGE
    echo-host    echo.starterkits.online    Pending   ACMEUserRegistered   ACMECertificateChallenge   3s
    quote-host   quote.starterkits.online   Pending   ACMEUserRegistered   ACMECertificateChallenge   3s
    ```

**Observations and results:**

It takes around `30s` to get the signed certificate for the hosts. At this point, you have the `Ambassador Edge Stack` installed and the `hosts` configured. But you still don't have the networking (eg. `DNS` and `Load Balancer`) configured to `route` traffic to the `cluster`. The missing parts can be noticed in the `Kubernetes` events of the hosts that you configured earlier.

Take a look and see what happens for the `echo-host`:

```shell
kubectl describe host echo-host -n ambassador
```

The output looks similar to the following:

```text
Events:
  Type     Reason   Age                From                   Message

[echo.starterkits.online] acme: error: 400 :: urn:ietf:params:acme:error:dns :: DNS problem: SERVFAIL looking up A for echo.starterkits.online - the domain's nameservers may be malfunctioning
...
```

As seen above, the last `event` tells that there's no `A` record to point to the `echo` host for the `starterkits.online` domain, which results in a lookup failure. You will learn how to fix this issue, in the next step of the tutorial.

## Step 4 - Configuring the DO Domain for Ambassador Edge Stack

In this step, you will configure the `DigitalOcean` domain for `AES`, using `doctl`. Then, you will create the domain `A` records for each host: `echo` and `quote`.

First, please issue the below command to create a new `domain` (`starterkits.online`, in this example):

```shell
doctl compute domain create starterkits.online
```

The output looks similar to the following:

```text
Domain           TTL
starterkits.online    0
```

**Note:**

**YOU NEED TO ENSURE THAT YOUR DOMAIN REGISTRAR IS CONFIGURED TO POINT TO DIGITALOCEAN NAMESERVERS**. More information on how to do that is available [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-point-to-digitalocean-nameservers-from-common-domain-registrars).

Next, you will add required `A` records for the `hosts` you created earlier. First, you need to identify the `Load Balancer` IP that points to your `Kubernetes` cluster (the `Ambassador Edge Stack` deployed earlier creates one for you). Pick the one that matches your configuration from the list:

```shell
doctl compute load-balancer list
```

Then, add the records (please replace the `<>` placeholders accordingly). You can change the `TTL` value as per your requirement:

```shell
doctl compute domain records create starterkits.online --record-type "A" --record-name "echo" --record-data "<your_lb_ip_address>" --record-ttl "30"

doctl compute domain records create starterkits.online --record-type "A" --record-name "quote" --record-data "<your_lb_ip_address>" --record-ttl "30"
```

**Hint:**

If you have only one `LB` in your account, then please use the following snippet:

```shell
LOAD_BALANCER_IP=$(doctl compute load-balancer list --format IP --no-header)

doctl compute domain records create starterkits.online --record-type "A" --record-name "echo" --record-data "$LOAD_BALANCER_IP" --record-ttl "30"

doctl compute domain records create starterkits.online --record-type "A" --record-name "quote" --record-data "$LOAD_BALANCER_IP" --record-ttl "30"
```

**Observation and results:**

List the available records for the `starterkits.online` domain:

```shell
doctl compute domain records list starterkits.online
```

The output looks similar to the following:

```text
ID           Type    Name     Data                    Priority    Port    TTL     Weight
164171755    SOA     @        1800                    0           0       1800    0
164171756    NS      @        ns1.digitalocean.com    0           0       1800    0
164171757    NS      @        ns2.digitalocean.com    0           0       1800    0
164171758    NS      @        ns3.digitalocean.com    0           0       1800    0
164171801    A       echo     143.244.208.191         0           0       3600    0
164171809    A       quote    143.244.208.191         0           0       3600    0
```

Next, check the `AES` hosts status:

```shell
kubectl get hosts -n ambassador
```

The output looks similar to the following (the `STATE` column should display `Ready`):

```text
NAME         HOSTNAME                   STATE   PHASE COMPLETED   PHASE PENDING   AGE
echo-host    echo.starterkits.online    Ready                                     2m11s
quote-host   quote.starterkits.online   Ready                                     2m12s
```

**Note:**

In case the `hosts` are still in a `pending` state, it might be due to the `DNS` propagation delay. Please wait for a couple of minutes, and verify your hosts `STATE` column again.

At this point the network traffic will reach the `AES` enabled cluster, but you need to configure the `backend services paths` for each of the hosts. All `DNS` records have one thing in common: `TTL` or time to live. It determines how long a `record` can remain cached before it expires. Loading data from a local cache is faster, but visitors wonâ€™t see `DNS` changes until their local cache expires and gets updated after a new `DNS` lookup. As a result, higher `TTL` values give visitors faster performance, and lower `TTL` values ensure that `DNS` changes are picked up quickly. All `DNS` records require a minimum `TTL` value of `30 seconds`.

Please visit the [How to Create, Edit and Delete DNS Records](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/dns/how-to/manage-records) page for more information.

In the next step, you will create two simple `backend` services, to help you test the `Ambassador Edge Stack` setup.

## Step 5 - Creating the Ambassador Edge Stack Backend Services

In this step, you will deploy two example `backend` services (applications), named `echo` and `quote` to test the `Ambassador Edge Stack` setup.

You can have multiple `TLS` enabled `hosts` on the same cluster. On the other hand, you can have multiple `deployments` and `services` as well. So for each `backend` application, a corresponding `Kubernetes Deployment` and `Service` has to be created.

First, you define a new `namespace` for the `quote` and `echo` backend applications. This is good practice in general, because you don't want to pollute the `AES` namespace (or any other), with application specific stuff.

Steps to follow:

1. First, change directory (if not already) where the `Starter Kit` repository was cloned:

    ```shell
    cd Kubernetes-Starter-Kit-Developers
    ```

2. Next, create the `backend` namespace:

    ```shell
    kubectl create ns backend
    ```

3. Then, create the [echo](assets/manifests/echo_deployment.yaml) and [quote](assets/manifests/quote_deployment.yaml) deployments:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f 03-setup-ingress-ambassador/assets/manifests/echo_deployment.yaml

    kubectl apply -f 03-setup-ingress-ambassador/assets/manifests/quote_deployment.yaml
    ```

4. Finally, create the corresponding `services`:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f 03-setup-ingress-ambassador/assets/manifests/echo_service.yaml

    kubectl apply -f 03-setup-ingress-ambassador/assets/manifests/quote_service.yaml
    ```

**Observation and results:**

Inspect the `deployments` and `services` you just created:

```shell
kubectl get deployments -n backend
```

The output looks similar to the following (notice the `echo` and `quote` deployments):

```text
NAME    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
echo    1/1     1            1           2m22s
quote   1/1     1            1           2m23s
```

```shell
kubectl get svc -n backend
```

The output looks similar to the following (notice the `echo` and `quote` services):

```text
NAME    TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
echo    ClusterIP   10.245.175.185   <none>        80/TCP    2m32s
quote   ClusterIP   10.245.158.116   <none>        80/TCP    2m33s
```

In the next step, you will create the AES `Mappings` for the `quote` and `echo` backend applications.

## Step 6 - Configuring the Ambassador Edge Stack Mappings for Hosts

In this step, you will learn how to create the `Ambassador Edge Stack` mappings, so that your `backend` applications are ready for inbound/outbound `traffic`. The main goal here is to have a basic understanding on how the `AES` stack will `route` requests to each `application`, by introducing a new custom `AES` resource. Meet the [Mapping]((https://www.getambassador.io/docs/edge-stack/1.13/topics/using/intro-mappings)) CRD.

What a `Mapping` does, is to manage traffic routing for the `quote` and `echo` services. Each mapping has a set of fields, described below:

- `name` - a string identifying the `Mapping` (e.g. in diagnostics).
- `prefix` - the `URL` prefix identifying your resource.
- `service` - the name of the service handling the resource; must include the `namespace` (e.g. `myservice.othernamespace`) if the service is in a different namespace than `Ambassador Edge Stack`.

First, change directory (if not already) where the `Starter Kit` repository was cloned on your local machine:

```shell
cd Kubernetes-Starter-Kit-Developers
```

Next, create a `Mapping` for [echo](assets/manifests/echo_mapping.yaml) and [quote](assets/manifests/quote_mapping.yaml) backend applications:

```shell
kubectl apply -f 03-setup-ingress-ambassador/assets/manifests/echo_mapping.yaml

kubectl apply -f 03-setup-ingress-ambassador/assets/manifests/quote_mapping.yaml
```

**Observation and results:**

Inspect the `AES` mappings:

```shell
kubectl get mappings -n ambassador
```

The output looks similar to the following (notice the `echo-backend` and `quote-backend` lines, and how each maps to a `SOURCE HOST`, followed by a `SOURCE PREFIX`, and finally a destination service - `DEST SERVICE`):

```text
NAME                          SOURCE HOST                SOURCE PREFIX                               DEST SERVICE     STATE   REASON
ambassador-devportal                                     /documentation/                             127.0.0.1:8500           
ambassador-devportal-api                                 /openapi/                                   127.0.0.1:8500           
ambassador-devportal-assets                              /documentation/(assets|styles)/(.*)(.css)   127.0.0.1:8500           
ambassador-devportal-demo                                /docs/                                      127.0.0.1:8500           
echo-backend                  echo.starterkits.online    /echo/                                      echo.backend             
quote-backend                 quote.starterkits.online   /quote/                                     quote.backend 
```

- [Host](https://www.getambassador.io/docs/edge-stack/1.13/topics/running/host-crd/) resource: sets the `hostname` by which `Ambassador Edge Stack` will be accessed and secured with `TLS` certificates.

In the next step, you will learn how to use the `DigitalOcean Proxy Protocol` with `AES`.

## Step 7 - Enabling Proxy Protocol

A `L4` load balancer replaces the original `client IP` with its `own IP` address. This is a problem, as you will lose the `client IP` visibility in the application, so you need to enable `proxy protocol`. Proxy protocol enables a `L4 Load Balancer` to communicate the `original` client `IP`. For this to work, you need to configure both `DigitalOcean Load Balancer` and `AES`. After deploying the [AES Backend Services](#step-5---creating-the-ambassador-edge-stack-backend-services), and manually enabling the `proxy protocol`, you need to configure `Ambassador Module` to enable `AES` to use the `proxy protocol`.

To enable proxy protocol for `AES`, you need to:

1. Enable `proxy` protocol on `DigitalOcean` LB through service `annotation` on `Ambassador` LB service.
2. Enable `proxy` protocol configuration on `Ambassador Edge Stack` end.

For different `DigitalOcean` load balancer configurations, please refer to the examples from the official [DigitalOcean Cloud Controller Manager](https://github.com/digitalocean/digitalocean-cloud-controller-manager/tree/master/docs/controllers/services/examples) documentation. Proxy protocol on the `LoadBalancer` is enabled with the following `annotation` on `Ambassador` LB service: `service.beta.kubernetes.io/do-loadbalancer-enable-proxy-protocol: "true"`. You must **NOT** create a load balancer with `Proxy` support by using the `DigitalOcean` web console, as any setting done outside `DOKS` is automatically `overridden` by DOKS `reconciliation`.

You can enable proxy support in the `Ambassador` stack via the [aes_proxy_module](assets/manifests/aes_proxy_module.yaml) manifest.

Change directory where the `Starter Kit` repository was cloned and:

```shell
kubectl apply -f 03-setup-ingress-ambassador/assets/manifests/aes_proxy_module.yaml
```

Please note that module configuration is a `global` option (enable/disable) for `AES`.

In the next step, you will test the `AES` mappings configuration, and perform HTTP requests on the backend services using `curl`.

## Step 8 - Verifying the Ambassador Edge Stack Setup

In the current setup, you have two hosts configured with `TLS` termination and `ACME` protocol: `quote.starterkits.online` and `echo.starterkits.online`. By creating AES `Mappings` it's very easy to have `TLS` termination support and `API Gateway` capabilities.

If pinging `quote.starterkits.online` or `echo.starterkits.online` in the terminal you can see that packets are being sent to the `AES` external `IP`. Then, `AES` is using the mapping feature to reach the endpoints. Next, you're going to verify if service mappings are working.

First, inspect the `Ambassador` services:

```shell
kubectl get svc -n ambassador 
```

The output looks similar to:

```text
NAME               TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)                      AGE
ambassador         LoadBalancer   10.245.39.13   68.183.252.190   80:31499/TCP,443:30759/TCP   2d8h
ambassador-admin   ClusterIP      10.245.68.14   <none>           8877/TCP,8005/TCP            2d8h
ambassador-redis   ClusterIP      10.245.9.81    <none>           6379/TCP                     2d8h
```

Next, `ping` the `quote` service host:

```shell
ping quote.starterkits.online
```

The output looks similar to the following (notice that it hits the `AES` external IP: `68.183.252.190`):

```text
PING quote.starterkits.online (68.183.252.190): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 68.183.252.190: icmp_seq=0 ttl=54 time=199.863 ms
64 bytes from 68.183.252.190: icmp_seq=1 ttl=54 time=202.999 ms
...
```

Now, verify the `quote` backend service response using `curl`:

```shell
curl -Li http://quote.starterkits.online/quote/
```

The output looks similar to (notice how it automatically redirects, and is using `https` instead):

```text

location: https://quote.starterkits.online/quote/

    "quote": "The last sentence you read is often sensible nonsense.",
    "time": "2021-08-12T18:28:43.861400709Z"
}
```

Finally, please do the same for the `echo` service:

```shell
curl -Li http://echo.starterkits.online/echo/
```

The output looks similar to (notice how it automatically redirects, and is using `https` instead):

```text

location: https://echo.starterkits.online/echo/

```

Given that `proxy protocol` is configured, you should see the original `client IP` in the https `request header` as well.

If everything looks like above, you configured the `Ambassador Edge Stack` successfully. Next, you will analyze the `Ambassador Edge Stack` from the resource usage standpoint, and learn about recommended values for the replica count, as well as resource requests and limits.

## Step 9 - Performance Considerations for the Ambassador Edge Stack

The performance of `Ambassador Edge Stack's` control plane can be characterized along a number of different `dimensions`. The following list contains each `dimension` that has an impact at the application level:

- The number of `TLSContext` resources.
- The number of `Host` resources.
- The number of `Mapping` resources per Host resource.
- The number of `unconstrained Mapping resources` (these will apply to all `Host` resources).

Taking each key factor from above into consideration and mapping it to the Kubernetes realm, it means that you need to adjust the `requests` and `limits` for the deployment pods, and/or the `replica` count.

Talking about resource usage limits, `Kubernetes` will generally kill an `Ambassador Edge Stack` pod for one of two reasons:

- Exceeding `memory` limits.
- Failed `liveness/readiness` probes.

`Ambassador Edge Stack` can `grow` in terms of `memory usage`, so it's very likely to get the application pods killed because of `OOM` issues.

In general you should try to keep AES `memory usage` below `50%` of the pod's `limit`. This may seem like a generous safety margin, but when reconfiguration occurs, `Ambassador Edge Stack` requires `additional memory to avoid disrupting active connections`.

Going further, what you can do on the `Kubernetes` side, is to adjust deployment `replica count`, and resource `requests` for pods.

### Adjusting Deployment Replica Count

Based on our findings, a value of `2` should suffice in case of small `development` environments.

Next, you're going to scale the `Ambassador Edge Stack` deployment, and adjust the `replicaCount` value, via the [ambassador-values.yaml](assets/manifests/ambassador-values-v6.7.13.yaml) file provided in the `Starter Kit` Git repository.

Steps to follow:

1. First, change directory where the `Starter Kit` Git repository was cloned.
2. Next, open and inspect the `replicaCount` section, from the `03-setup-ingress-ambassador/assets/manifests/ambassador-values-v6.7.13.yaml` file provided in the `Starter Kit` repository, using a text editor of your choice (preferably with `YAML` lint support). It has the required values already set for you to use. For example, you can use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com):

   ```shell
   code 03-setup-ingress-ambassador/assets/manifests/ambassador-values-v6.7.13.yaml
   ```

3. Then, apply changes using a `Helm` upgrade:

    ```shell
    HELM_CHART_VERSION="6.7.13"

    helm upgrade ambassador datawire/ambassador --version "$HELM_CHART_VERSION" \
        --namespace ambassador \
        -f "03-setup-ingress-ambassador/assets/manifests/ambassador-values-v${HELM_CHART_VERSION}.yaml"
    ```

4. Finally, check the `ambassador` deployment `replica count` (it should scale to `2`):

    ```shell
    kubectl get deployments -n ambassador
    ```

    The output looks similar to:

    ```text
    NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    ambassador         2/2     3            3           6d3h
    ambassador-agent   1/1     1            1           6d3h
    ambassador-redis   1/1     1            1           6d3h
    ```

### Adjusting Resource Requests

In this section, you're going to adjust resource requests via `Helm`, and tune the `memory` requests value to a reasonable value, by using the [ambassador-values.yaml](assets/manifests/ambassador-values-v6.7.13.yaml) file provided in the `Starter Kit` Git repository.

Based on our findings, the memory requests should be adjusted to a value of `200m`, which satisfies most development needs in general.

Steps to follow:

1. First, change directory where the `Starter Kit` Git repository was cloned.
2. Next, open and inspect the `resources` section, from the `03-setup-ingress-ambassador/assets/manifests/ambassador-values-v6.7.13.yaml` file provided in the `Starter Kit` repository, using a text editor of your choice (preferably with `YAML` lint support). It has the required values already set for you to use. For example, you can use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com):

   ```shell
   code 03-setup-ingress-ambassador/assets/manifests/ambassador-values-v6.7.13.yaml
   ```

3. Then, run a `Helm` upgrade to apply changes:

    ```shell
    HELM_CHART_VERSION="6.7.13"

    helm upgrade ambassador datawire/ambassador --version "$HELM_CHART_VERSION" \
        --namespace ambassador \
        -f "03-setup-ingress-ambassador/assets/manifests/ambassador-values-v${HELM_CHART_VERSION}.yaml"
    ```

4. Finally, check the `memory requests` new `value` - it should say `200Mi` (look in the `Containers` section, from below command output):

    ```shell
    kubectl describe deployment ambassador -n ambassador
    ```

    The output looks similar to:

    ```text
    ...
    Containers:
      ambassador:
       Image:       docker.io/datawire/aes:1.13.10
       Ports:       8080/TCP, 8443/TCP, 8877/TCP
       Host Ports:  0/TCP, 0/TCP, 0/TCP
       Limits:
         cpu:     1
         memory:  600Mi
       Requests:
         cpu:      200m
         memory:   200Mi
    ...
    ```

Another way of finding and setting the right values for requests/limits, is to evaluate `Ambassador` for a period of time (a few days or so). Then, you can run `statistical` queries via `Prometheus` and find the best `values` for your `use case`. A good article to read on this topic, can be found [here](https://blog.kubecost.com/blog/requests-and-limits).

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to set up an `Ingress` controller for your `DOKS` cluster, using the `Ambassador Edge Stack`. Then, you discovered how `AES` simplifies some of the common tasks, like: handling `SSL` certificates for your applications, enabling `TLS` termination, `routing` traffic to `backend` services, and `adjusting` resource `requests` and `limits` for the stack.

Next, `monitoring` plays a key role in every `production ready` system. In [Section 4 - Set up Prometheus Stack](../04-setup-prometheus-stack), you will learn how to enable monitoring for your `DOKS` cluster, as well as for the `AES` stack, using `Prometheus`.
